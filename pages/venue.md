After getting down at Gokarna Road (the railways station is called road because its too small to be called a station), its just 6kms to the beach.

You can find a taxi or a bus to Gokarna Beach or Gokarna Bus Stand (about 500mts away from beach)
Reach the Beach. Walk on sand for about 800mts towards right. 
You'll see a Bob Marley wall painting.

<!-- TODO: Add photo of the painting -->

If you don't see Bob, you haven't walked enough.

Welcome to Manju's Place. Call him up at [+91-98861-90282](tel:+919886190282).
